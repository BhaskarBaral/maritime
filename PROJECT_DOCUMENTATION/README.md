## 📌 Project Overview at a Glance

* **Project Name**: Maritime Port Intelligence Platform (MPIP) / Maritime Port Enhanced
* **One-Line Explanation**: An AI-powered, data-grounded maritime decision-support platform designed to deliver predictive cargo volume forecasting, trade lane momentum analytics, risk/anomaly detection, and interactive port scenario simulation.
* **Main Objective**: Bridge fragmented maritime datasets and convert historical port operations into actionable, forward-looking decisions for port authorities, customs agencies, and shipping line operators.
* **Primary Focus**: **Predictive Cargo Analytics & Intelligence** (specifically grounded on actual multi-year monthly port traffic records mapped to New Mangalore Port Authority — NMPA).
* **Technologies**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing, Multi-Feature Ridge Regression, Plotly, Docker, REST APIs.
* **Main Features**:
  1. ⭐ **Predictive Cargo Analytics & Volume Forecasting** (Holt-Winters + Ridge Regression with 95% dynamic confidence bounds)
  2. **Commodity & Trade Demand Intelligence** (Trade lane momentum, YoY growth tracking, commodity price indices)
  3. **Cargo Anomaly & Risk Intelligence** (Isolation Forest, LSTM, Autoencoder & Transformer simulation with severity progression)
  4. **Explainable Forecast Drivers** (Quantified weights for hinterland consumer demand, monsoon swells, and market inputs)
  5. **Model Validation & Out-of-Sample Backtesting** (WAPE, MAPE, MAE, RMSE performance comparison vs Seasonal Naive baseline)
  6. **Interactive What-If Cargo Scenario Simulator** (Stress-testing port throughput against vessel arrival spikes, trade demand shifts, and weather delays)
  7. **Executive Command Center & Digital Twin** (Real-time KPIs, berth utilization, live vessel positions, revenue trends, and operational stress-testing)
  8. **AI Maritime Copilot** (LangGraph 3-tier cognitive dispatcher with specialized agent roster)
